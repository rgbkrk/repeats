Since I keep repeating myself when responding to particular kinds of issues, I figured it was time to curate them. These issues are likely a consistent user experience problem, which we need to fix with:

* Better Documentation
* Improved experience (code, specs)
* More maintainers (because I alone can't figure this out)

In the meantime, this gives me a chance to reflect while collating information and responses.
